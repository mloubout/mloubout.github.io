Experience
----------

July 2020– February 2023
:   **Postdoctoral Fellow**: Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA

    *High performance/low memory randomized linear algebra for backpropagation based inverse problems*

    *Cloud HPC for separable problems (task parallel)*

    *Supervising the PhD and MSc students*

    *Managing and developping the software stack for the Lab ([slimgroup])*

    *Machine learning for geophysical and medical wave-equation based inverse problems*

    *HPC for machine learning*

    *Geological Carbon Storage seismic monitoring*


Computational experience
----------

Open Source
:   **[Devito]**: A symbolic domain specific language (DSL) for stencil computation with just-in-time compilation and code generation. Achieves state of the art performance while providing a high-level mathematical interface to the users for the development of stencil based applications.
:   **[JUDI]**: Linear algebra high level API for wave-equation based inversion. This pacage is built on top of Devito to have high performance wave-equation solvers. A new additional Azure batch extension was developped for scalability [JUDI4Cloud].
:   **[XConv]**: High performance low memory convolutional layer. This repository implements both in julia (for Flux.jl) and in python (for pytorch) a convolutional layer that has virtually a zero memory imprnt for training using randomized linear algebra to compute an unbiased estimate of the gradient with respect to the weights. Additionaly, a byte only implementation of the ReLU layer leads to memry reduction by a factor of X2 for full networks.
:   **[dfno]**: Model parallel (MPI model decomposition) implementation of Fourier Neural Operators for PyTorch. Extension of distdl, a model parallel extension of PyTorch.
:   **[InvertibleNetworks.jl]**: Native Julia implementation of invertible networks for variational inference, generative models and normalizing flows.

---

Programming Languages
:   **Python:** Main programming language for the development of [Devito] and machine learning applications.
:   **Julia:** Heavy development of research software at  Georgia Tech ([slimgroup]) in Julia
:   **docker** Developped and automatized the deployement of [Devito] and [JUDI] images through CI (github actions).
:   Knowledge of **C**, **Linux**, **Bash**, **PyTorch**, **Azure**, **Latex**, **Markdown**, **Matlab**, **MPI**, **OPenMP**, **OpenACC**

---

HPC
:   **[Devito]:** Weak and strong scaling benchmarks of [Devito] on on-premise (Imperical college) and Cloud (Azure) hardware.
:   **[JUDI]:** Implementation and deployment at scale of [JUDI] on clusters and Azure Batch (up 300 nodes).
:   **Optimum (2015-2018):** Early PhD 50 nodes cluster. Development of parallel Matlab seismic inverse problem algorithms (FWI/RTM). 
:   **YEMOJA (2017-2018):** Part of a collaboration with SENAI-CIMANTEC. Scaling of our Matlab and Julia framework to hundred of nodes.
:   **Cloud (2018-):** Serverless and clusterless framework for task parallel inverse problems on AWS and Azure.
:   **Perlmutter (2022-):** Scaling of MPI-parallel Fourier Neural Operator on Perlmutter (and previously Summit).
