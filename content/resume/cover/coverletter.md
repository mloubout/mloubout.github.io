To whom it may concern:
<!-- 
I have recently (May 2020) graduated with a Ph.D from the CSE department at Georgia Insitute of Technology where I worked primarily on high-performance computing for large-scale wave-equation based inverse problems. More specifically, my research focused on high-performance software solutions and algorithms for wave-equation based seismic, and later on medical, inversion, imaging and monitoring. This research involved multiple fields such as programming (Python, Julia, Matlab, C, MPI, OpenMP, OpenAcc, Pytorch), and the development of an high-level abstraction for computational physics: a Domain-specific languages and code generation for finite-difference simulations called [Devito](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito) and a Julia linear algebra abstraction for inverse problems called [JUDI.jl](https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl). Additionnally, my research included Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure), applied mathematics, and machine learning. Throughout my PhD and my current postodoctoral appointment, I have committed to open science and to the development of high-level abstractions for scalable HPC software enabling research for domain specialists. I have primarily developped these software in Python and Julia, two languages well suited for abstracted saoftware development while enabling performance through code generation and just-in-time compilation. Additionally, I have been working in the past two years on applying and extendind seismic imaging methods to photoacoustic imaging and carbon storage and sequestration monitoring. These new axis of research have broaden my knowledge of inverse problems and machine learning augmented physical inversion.

I believe that my experience, motivation and skills would be a great addition to your team. My collaborators and former supervisors can attest that I would be a valuable addition to the research team with my work ethic, productivity, and the skills I developed and perfected during my training as a student and now an independent researcher.

It would be a privilege to have the opportunity to discuss in more detail this opportunity at your earlier convenience. 
Thank you for your time. -->

My recent research in computational inverse problems for large-scale wave-equation inverse problems and uncertainty quantification and its relevance to the work you do motivated me to apply to the Research Software Enginee position.

My experience as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Georgia Institute of Technology would apply perfectly to this position. Over the past few years, I have implemented state-of-the-art software for sclalable physics-based machine learning and successfully used those for the development of new uncertainty quantification applications to PDE-constrained inverse problems such as photoacoustic and ultrasound medical imaging. This work involved working with large-scale datasets, real-world applications, and the associated large datasets and computational requirements. My research and software enabled the application of theoretical concepts to conventionally computationally unfeasible problems.

I am excitedabout this opportunity, and my collaborators can attest that I would be a valuable addition to the research team with my work ethic, productivity, and the skills I developed and perfected during my training as a student and now an independent researcher.
