	abstract = {Geological carbon storage represents one of the few truly scalable technologies capable of reducing the CO$_2$ concentration in the atmosphere. While this technology has the potential to scale, its success hinges on our ability to mitigate its risks. An important aspect of risk mitigation concerns assurances that the injected CO$_2$ remains within the storage complex. Amongst the different monitoring modalities, seismic imaging stands out with its ability to attain high resolution and high fidelity images. However, these superior features come, unfortunately, at prohibitive costs and time-intensive efforts potentially rendering extensive seismic monitoring undesirable. To overcome this shortcoming, we present a methodology where time-lapse images are created by inverting non-replicated time-lapse monitoring data jointly. By no longer insisting on replication of the surveys to obtain high fidelity time-lapse images and differences, extreme costs and time-consuming labor are averted. To demonstrate our approach, hundreds of noisy time-lapse seismic datasets are simulated that contain imprints of regular CO$_2$ plumes and irregular plumes that leak. These time-lapse datasets are subsequently inverted to produce time-lapse difference images used to train a deep neural classifier. The testing results show that the classifier is capable of detecting CO$_2$ leakage automatically on unseen data and with a reasonable accuracy.},

	abstract = {An important concern in seismic inverse problems is the large and varying size of observed data. The large size can cause computational cost concerns and its varying size (such as when changing receiver geometries) implies the need to rerun inference algorithms from scratch for each new observation. Motivated by these two problems, we take inspiration from the statistics literature which commonly relies on summary statistic of observed data. Summary statistic compress the observed data leaving only information needed for inference. In this work, we argue that the adjoint operator provides a natural candidate for a summary function in the context of physics-based inverse problems. We first mathematically show that for certain general assumptions transforming data under the adjoint operator defines a new conditional distribution which preserves the expectations of the original posterior. We validate our hypothesis by evaluating our framework in a learned amortized inference algorithm. Our seismic and medical synthetic experiments show computational gains and increased quality of point estimates using our framework. We discuss statistical metrics that show our learned posterior is well calibrated therefore justifying its use in uncertainty quantification.},

It is of great importance to quantify the uncertainty in seismic imaging result from various background models. With Fourier neural operators as a learned surrogate, this continuation from a given background model to an unseen background model can be quite accurately estimated with near-zero cost. However, the limitation of the prior art is that the input background model and the survey area are assumed to be fixed. The main contribution of this work is to extend the Fourier neural operator surrogate to be amortized over different given background models and survey areas. We verify the effectiveness of our learned surrogates by a realistic example on different areas of Parihaka dataset against different background models.},

Recent work on time-lapse seismic monitoring of CO$_2$ storage has shown promising results in its ability to monitor the growth of the CO$_2$ plume from surface recorded seismic data. However, due to the low sensitivity of seismic imaging to CO$_2$ concentration, additional developments are required to efficiently interpret the seismic images for leakage. In this work, we introduce a binary classification of time-lapse seismic images to delineate CO$_2$ plumes (leakage) using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Additionally, we localize the leakage region of CO$_2$ plumes by leveraging Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods.},

We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) discriminative classifier and also a generative classifier and compared their performances in CO2 leakage detection. The accuracy of our discriminative classifier on the test data is 85\% and that of the generative classifier is 90\%.

	year = {2022},
	month = {11},
	abstract = {Numerical surrogates are models which learn to mimic a complex physical process (such as the solution to a PDE produced by a solver) from a set of input/output pairs. Fourier neural operators (FNOs) are a specific type of numerical surrogate which use a learned matched filter to quickly approximate solutions to relatively smooth complex physical processes. In the case of carbon capture sequestration (CCS) technology, FNOs have been shown to well-approximate solutions to the two-phase flow equations, with speedups of 1,000 to 10,000 times at inference time versus a tradtitional solver. This speed combined with the fact that FNOs are differentiable with respect to their input parameters allows for inverse and uncertainty quantification problems to theoretically be solved on real 3D data, a previously intractible task. However, due to the size of the input data, network weights, and optimizer state, FNOs have thus far been limited to small to medium 2D and 3D problems, well below the size of an industry standard such as the Sleipner benchmark. Here we alleviate this problem by proposing a model-parallel FNO which makes use of domain decomposition of the input data and network weights, and exploits architectural features of FNOs to also include a natural form of asynchronous pipeline parallelism. Our network can scale to arbitrary problem sizes on CPU and GPU systems.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new method that combines check-pointing methods with error-controlled lossy compression for large-scale high-performance Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI), an inverse problem commonly used in geophysical exploration. This combination can significantly reduce data movement, allowing a reduction in run time as well as peak memory. In the Exascale computing era, frequent data transfer (e.g., memory bandwidth, PCIe bandwidth for GPUs, or network) is the performance bottleneck rather than the peak FLOPS of the processing unit. Like many other adjoint-based optimization problems, FWI is costly in terms of the number of floating-point operations, large memory footprint during backpropagation, and data transfer overheads. Past work for adjoint methods has developed checkpointing methods that reduce the peak memory requirements during backpropagation at the cost of additional floating-point computations. Combining this traditional checkpointing with error-controlled lossy compression, we explore the three-way tradeoff between memory, precision, and time to solution. We investigate how approximation errors introduced by lossy compression of the forward solution impact the objective function gradient and final inverted solution. Empirical results from these numerical experiments indicate that high lossy-compression rates (compression factors ranging up to 100) have a relatively minor impact on convergence rates and the quality of the final solution.},

However, due to the high dimensionality of their input data and network weights, FNOs have so far only been applied to two-dimensional or small three-dimensional problems. To remove this limited problem-size barrier, we propose a model-parallel version of FNOs based on domain-decomposition of both the input data and network weights.

Our findings show that by {\textquotedblleft}freezing{\textquotedblright} expensive layers we can efficiently train a normalizing flow on 3D volumes. Using this NF architecture, we train a generative model on volume sections of the 3D BG compass model. Our method produces visually plausible generative samples which are efficient to produce. We demonstrate its practical use by using our trained generative model as an implicit prior in a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) framework. We evaluate this MAP framework by estimating the solution of a inverse problem in seismic imaging. Our method results in higher SNR estimates than the baseline and in less iterations, importantly saving the computational cost of evaluating the expensive 3D PDE solver during optimization. Finally, through scaling analysis of training cost, we show that NF convolutional layers allow this approach to scale favorably to larger volumes.},

	abstract = {Due to the tremendous cost of seismic data acquisition, methods have been developed to reduce the amount of data acquired by designing optimal missing trace reconstruction algorithms. These technologies are designed to record as little data as possible in the field, while providing accurate wavefield reconstruction in the areas of the survey that are not recorded. This is achieved by designing randomized subsampling masks that allow for accurate wavefield reconstruction via matrix completion methods. Motivated by these recent results, we propose a simulation-free seismic survey design that aims at improving the quality of a given randomized subsampling using a simulated annealing algorithm that iteratively increases the spectral gap of the subsampling mask, a property recently linked to the quality of the reconstruction. We demonstrate that our proposed method improves the data reconstruction quality for a fixed subsampling rate on a realistic synthetic dataset.},

	abstract = {While time-lapse seismic has been applied successfully to CO2 sequestration monitoring, it remains a challenging problem since replicated dense surveys come at a very high cost in the field. Wavefield reconstruction based on matrix completion (MC) from randomized subsampled data is an efficient way to reduce operational costs. This technique allows for accurate time-lapse reconstruction by employing the joint recovery model (JRM), which capitalizes on the fact that different vintages share a common component. However, combining JRM with optimal time-lapse acquisition survey design remains an unexplored area of research. In expander graph theory, spectral gap (SG) reveals the source-receiver layout connectivity and is related to reconstruction quality during MC. Building on these insights, we proposed a simulation free time-lapse survey design based on JRM that aims to get similar reconstructed quality without insisting on replicate surveys, which significantly reduces the cost in the field. This approach uses the simulated annealing algorithm to find subsampling masks for each vintage. Numerical experiments confirm a direct correlation between increased spectral gap and promising time-lapse reconstruction quality.},

Uncertainty quantification is essential for determining how variability in the background models affects seismic imaging. Due to the costs associated with the forward Born modeling operator as well as the high dimensionality of seismic images, quantification of uncertainty is computationally expensive. As such, the main contribution of this work is a survey-specific Fourier neural operator surrogate to velocity continuation that maps seismic images associated with one background model to another virtually for free. While being trained with only 200 background and seismic image pairs, this surrogate is able to accurately predict seismic images associated with new background models, thus accelerating seismic imaging uncertainty quantification. We support our method with a realistic data example in which we quantify seismic imaging uncertainties using a Fourier neural operator surrogate, illustrating how variations in background models affect the position of reflectors in a seismic image.},

	abstract = {Time-lapse seismic monitoring of carbon storage and sequestration is often challenging because the time-lapse signature of the growth of CO$_2$ plumes is weak in amplitude and therefore difficult to detect seismically. This situation is compounded by the fact that the surveys are often coarsely sampled and not replicated to reduce costs. As a result, images obtained for different vintages (baseline and monitor surveys) often contain artifacts that may be attributed wrongly to time-lapse changes. To address these issues, we propose to invert the baseline and monitor surveys jointly. By using the joint recovery model, we exploit information shared between multiple time-lapse surveys. Contrary to other time-lapse methods, our approach does not rely on replicating the surveys to detect time-lapse changes. To illustrate this advantage, we present a numerical sensitivity study where CO$_2$ is injected in a realistic synthetic model. This model is representative of the geology in the southeast of the North Sea, an area currently considered for carbon sequestration. Our example demonstrates that the joint recovery model improves the quality of time-lapse images allowing us to monitor the CO$_2$ plume seismically.},

If these challenges were not bad enough, modern applications of computational imaging increasingly call for the assessment of uncertainty on the image itself and on subsequent tasks conducted on these images. By making use of a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (McMC) sampling technique, we demonstrate how uncertainty in the data can be propagated to the task of seismic horizon tracking. While this example shows that uncertainty can in principle be handled in a systematic manner by using neural nets as deep priors, it unfortunately also reveals that the McMC method fundamentally lacks ability to scale to relevant problem sizes. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce a variational formulation based on normalizing flows. In this approach, invertible neural networks are trained to generate samples from the posterior. There are strong indications that this approach has the capability to scale better to problems where the forward operator is expensive to evaluate.},

	abstract = {The posterior probability distribution provides a comprehensive description of the solution in ill-posed inverse problems. Sampling from the posterior distribution in the context of seismic imaging is challenged by the high-dimensionality of the unknown and the expensive-to-evaluate forward operator. These challenges limit the applicability of Markov Chain sampling methods due to the costs associated with the forward operator. Moreover, explicitly choosing a prior distribution that captures the true heterogeneity exhibited by the Earth{\textquoteright}s subsurface further complicates casting seismic imaging into a Bayesian framework. To handle this situation and to assess uncertainty, we propose a data-driven variational inference approach based on conditional normalizing flows (NFs). The proposed scheme leverages existing data, which are in the form of low- and high-fidelity migrated image pairs, to train a conditional NF capable of characterizing the posterior distribution. After training, the NF can be used to sample from the posterior distribution associated with a previously unseen seismic survey, which is in some sense close, e.g., data from a neighboring survey area. In our numerical example, we obtain high-fidelity images from the Parihaka dataset and low-fidelity images are derived from these images through the process of demigration, followed by adding band-limited noise and migration. During inference, given shot records from a new neighboring seismic survey, we first compute the reverse-time migration image. Next, by feeding this low-fidelity migrated image to the NF we gain access to samples from the posterior distribution virtually for free. We use these samples to compute a high-fidelity image including a first assessment of the image{\textquoteright}s reliability.},

Instead of relying on (optimal) checkpointing or invertibility of the network layers{\textendash}-to recover the activations during backpropagation{\textendash}-we propose to approximate the gradient of convolutional layers in neural networks with a multi-channel randomized trace estimation technique. Compared to other methods, this approach is simple, amenable to analyses, and leads to a greatly reduced memory footprint. Even though the randomized trace estimation introduces stochasticity during training, we argue that this is of little consequence as long as the induced errors are of the same order as errors in the gradient due to the use of stochastic gradient descent. We discuss the performance of networks trained with stochastic backpropagation and how the error can be controlled while maximizing memory usage and minimizing computational overhead.},

Considering the large dimension difference between seismic data and velocity model, we reduce the data dimension by calculating its reverse time. After that, we train the CNF on pairs of migrated data and velocity. During inference, given a new seismic data, feeding the corresponding migrated image into the trained CNF will lead to posterior samples of the velocity inversion distribution. In addition, uncertainty quantification of the inverted results can be achieved by statistical metrics like mean and standard deviation. In our numerical example, the implementation is based on open-sourced software InvertibleNetworks.jl (Witte et al., 2021), JUDI.jl (Witte et al., 2019) and Devito (Louboutin et al., 2019). The training dataset are built based on the SEG/EAGE Overthrust model. For an unseen seismic data, the posterior samples of inversion results given by the trained CNF can be considered as good estimates of the true velocity. Especially, judging from the metrics like MAE, MSE, PSNR, SSIM, et al., the posterior mean is usually closer to the true velocity and the standard deviation indicates that the velocity value is more reliable within the subsurface layers than that on layer edges. Moreover, the inverted results, either the posterior samples or posterior mean, can be used as an initial model in the subsequent FWI for a more accurate result.},

	abstract = {Stencil kernels dominate a range of scientific applications including seismic and medical imaging, image processing, and neural networks. Temporal blocking is a performance optimisation that aims to reduce the required memory bandwidth of stencil computations by re-using data from the cache for multiple time steps. It has already been shown to be beneficial for this class of algorithms. However, optimising stencils for practical applications remains challenging. These computations often include sparsely located operators, not aligned with the computational grid ("off-the-grid"). For example, our work is motivated by sources that inject a wavefield and measurements interpolating grid values. The resulting data dependencies make the adoption of temporal blocking much more challenging. We propose a methodology to inspect these data dependencies and reorder the computation, leading to performance gains in stencil codes where temporal blocking has not been applicable. We implement this novel scheme in the Devito domain-specific compiler toolchain. Devito implements a domain-specific language embedded in Python to generate optimised partial differential equation solvers using the finite-difference method from high-level symbolic problem definitions. We evaluate our scheme using isotropic acoustic, anisotropic acoustic and isotropic elastic wave propagators of industrial significance. Performance evaluation, after auto-tuning, shows that this enables substantial performance improvement through temporal blocking, over highly-optimised vectorized spatially-blocked code of up to 1.6x.},

A wider adoption is currently being limited by available computational resources and the classical limitations of non-linear optimization, which often produces suboptimal local minima. A class of methods based on the inexact solution of the wave equation, known as wavefield reconstruction inversion, have shown remarkable robustness towards local minima, however the solvers required for the inexact wave equation scale badly to 3D problems. We propose a reformulation of wavefield reconstruction inversion which involves the solution of the classical time-domain wave equation, and it is practical for large-scale problems.

As an alternative to the generic lift and shift approach, we consider the specific application of seismic imaging and demonstrate a serverless and event-driven pproach for running large-scale instances of this problem in the cloud. Instead of permanently running compute instances, our workflow is based on a serverless architecture with high throughput batch computing and event-driven computations, in which computational resources are only running as long as they are utilized. We demonstrate that this approach is very flexible and allows for resilient and nested levels of parallelization, including domain decomposition for solving the underlying partial differential equations. While the event-driven approach introduces some overhead as computational resources are repeatedly restarted, it inherently provides resilience to instance shut-downs and allows a significant reduction of cost by avoiding idle instances, thus making the cloud a viable alternative to on-premise clusters for large-scale seismic imaging.},

	abstract = {Seismic inversion, and more generally geophysical exploration, aims at better understanding the earth{\textquoteright}s subsurface, which is one of today{\textquoteright}s most important challenges. Firstly, it contains natural resources that are critical to our technologies such as water, minerals and oil and gas. Secondly, monitoring the subsurface in the context of CO2 sequestration, earthquake detection and global seismology are of major interests with regard to safety and the environment hazards. However, the technologies to monitor the subsurface or find resources are scientifically extremely challenging. Seismic inversion can be formulated as a mathematical optimization problem that minimizes the difference between field recorded data and numerically modeled synthetic data. The process of solving this optimization problem then requires to numerically model, thousands of times, wave-propagation in large three-dimensional representations of part of the earth subsurface. The mathematical and computational complexity of this problem, therefore, calls for software design that abstracts these requirements and facilitates algorithm and software development. My thesis addresses some of the challenges that arise from these problems; mainly the computational cost and access to the right software for research and development. In the first part, I will discuss a performance metric that improves the current runtime-only benchmarks in exploration geophysics. This metric, the roofline model, first provides insight at the hardware level of the performance of a given implementation relative to the maximum achievable performance. Second, this study demonstrates that the choice of numerical discretization has a major impact on the achievable performance depending on the hardware at hand and shows that a flexible framework with respect to the discretization parameters is necessary. In the second part, I will introduce and describe Devito, a symbolic finite-difference DSL that provides a high-level interface to the definition of partial differential equations (PDE) such as the wave equation. Devito, from the symbolic definition of PDEs, then generates and compiles highly optimized C code on-the-fly to compute the solution of the PDE. The combination of the high-level abstractions and the just-in-time compiler enable research for geophysical exploration and PDE-constrainted optimization based on the paradigm of separation of concerns. This allows researchers to concentrate on their respective field of study while having access to computationally performant solvers with a flexible and easy to use interface to successfully implement complex representations of the physics. The second part of my thesis will be split into two sub-parts; first describing the symbolic application programming interface (API), before describing and benchmarking the just-in-time compiler. I will end my thesis with concluding remarks, the latest developments and a brief description of projects that were enabled by Devito.},

This allows arbitrarily large adjoint computations with limited memory, at the cost of additional recomputations. In this paper we combine compression and checkpointing for the first time to compute a realistic seismic inversion.

However, in the time-domain, the computational cost and memory requirements of this approach scale with the size and recording length of the seismic experiment, thus making this approach often prohibitively expensive in practice. To overcome these issues, we borrow ideas from compressive sensing and signal processing and introduce an algorithm for sparsity-promoting seismic imaging using on-the-fly Fourier transforms. By computing gradients and functions values for random subsets of source locations and frequencies, we considerably limit the number of wave equation solves, while on-the-fly Fourier transforms allow computing an arbitrary number of monochromatic frequency-domain wavefields with a time-domain modeling code and without having to solve large-scale Helmholtz equations. The memory requirements of this approach are independent of the number of time steps and solely depend on the number of frequencies, which determine the amount of crosstalk and subsampling artifacts in the image. We show the application of our approach to several large-scale open source data sets and compare the results to a conventional time-domain approach with optimal checkpointing.},

We tackle these problems by introducing an algorithm for low-cost sparsity-promoting least-squares migration using on-the-fly Fourier transforms. We formulate the least-squares migration objective function in the frequency domain and compute gradients for randomized subsets of shot records and frequencies, thus significantly reducing data movement and the number of overall wave equations solves. By using on-the-fly Fourier transforms, we can compute an arbitrary number of monochromatic frequency-domain wavefields with a time-domain modeling code, instead of having to solve individual Helmholtz equations for each frequency, which quickly becomes computationally infeasible when moving to high frequencies. Our numerical examples demonstrate that compressive imaging with on-the-fly Fourier transforms provides a fast and memory-efficient alternative to time-domain imaging with optimal checkpointing, whose memory requirements for a fixed background model and source wavelet is independent of the number of time steps. Instead, memory and additional computational cost grow with the number of frequencies and determine the amount of subsampling artifacts and crosstalk. In contrast to optimal checkpointing, this offers the possibility to trade both memory and computational cost for image quality or a larger number of iterations and is advantageous in new computing environments such as the cloud, where compute is often cheaper than memory and data movement.},

	abstract = {We introduce Devito, a new domain-specific language for implementing high-performance finite difference partial differential equation solvers. The motivating application is exploration seismology where methods such as Full-Waveform Inversion and Reverse-Time Migration are used to invert terabytes of seismic data to create images of the earth{\textquoteright}s subsurface. Even using modern supercomputers, it can take weeks to process a single seismic survey and create a useful subsurface image. The computational cost is dominated by the numerical solution of wave equations and their corresponding adjoints. Therefore, a great deal of effort is invested in aggressively optimizing the performance of these wave-equation propagators for different computer architectures. Additionally, the actual set of partial differential equations being solved and their numerical discretization is under constant innovation as increasingly realistic representations of the physics are developed, further ratcheting up the cost of practical solvers. By embedding a domain-specific language within Python and making heavy use of SymPy, a symbolic mathematics library, we make it possible to develop finite difference simulators quickly using a syntax that strongly resembles the mathematics. The Devito compiler reads this code and applies a wide range of analysis to generate highly optimized and parallel code. This approach can reduce the development time of a verified and optimized solver from months to days.},

It is based on the optimization of the wave equation compliance, under the constraint of data misfit not exceeding a prescribed noise level. In the Lagrangian formulation, model and wavefield state variables are complemented with multipliers having the same dimension of data ("dual data" variables). Analogously to classical wavefield reconstruction inversion, the wavefield unknowns can be projected out in closed form, by solving a version of the augmented wave equation. This leads to a saddle-point problem whose variables are only model and dual data. As such, this formulation represents a model extension, and is potentially robust against local minima. The classical downsides of model extension methods and wavefield reconstruction inversion are here effectively mitigated: storage of the dual variables is affordable, the augmented wave equation is amenable to time-marching finite-difference schemes, and no continuation strategy for penalty parameters is needed, with the prospect of 3-D applications.},

A full-space optimization would require the storage of field variables for every frequency or time sample (and every source). Remedies via variable projection are well studied, but they entail the solution of a modified wave equation, which is costly both in frequency and time domain. Here, we explore an efficient alternative to WRI, where properties are complemented, instead, by elements of the dual data space. The starting point of our proposal is the denoising reformulation of WRI: the PDE compliance is optimized under the constraint of a given data fit. Since the field variable can be eliminated from the associated saddle-point problem, we obtain a new objective functional of only properties and Lagrange multipliers. Its evaluation, and gradient computation, involves the solution of the original wave equation, which is amenable to time-domain discretization. The optimization scheme of choice can now leverage on affordable storage of the iterates.},

However, so far little progress has been made in adapting the cloud for high performance computing (HPC) tasks, such as seismic imaging and inversion. As the cloud does not provide the same type of fast and reliable connections as conventional HPC clusters, porting legacy codes developed for HPC environments to the cloud is ineffective and misses out on an opportunity to take advantage of new technologies presented by the cloud. We present a novel approach of bringing seismic imaging and inversion workflows to the cloud, which does not rely on a traditional HPC environment, but is based on serverless and event-driven computations. Computational resources are assigned dynamically in response to events, thus minimizing idle time and providing resilience to hardware failures. We test our workflow on two large-scale imaging examples and demonstrate that cost-effective HPC in the cloud is possible, but requires careful reconsiderations of how to bring software to the cloud.},

	abstract = {In {\textquotedblleft}A large-scale framework for symbolic implementations of seismic inversion algorithms in Julia,{\textquotedblright} Witte et al. describe new developments in how to code complex geophysical algorithms in a concise way. Subsurface seismic imaging and parameter estimation are among the most computationally challenging problems in the scientific community. Codes for solving seismic inverse problems, such as FWI or least-squares reverse time migration (LS-RTM), need to be highly optimized, but at the same time, facilitate the implementation of complex optimization algorithms. Traditionally, production-level codes in the oil and gas industry were exclusively written in low-level languages, such as C or Fortran, with extensive amounts of manual performance optimizations, thus making code maintenance, debugging, and adoption of new algorithms prohibitively challenging. Witte et al. present a paradigm of software engineering for seismic inverse problems based on symbolic user interfaces and code generation with automated performance optimization. Inspired by recent deep learning frameworks, the Julia Devito inversion framework (JUDI; an open-source software package) combines high-level abstractions for expressing seismic inversion algorithms with a domain-specific language compiler called Devito for solving the underlying wave equations. Devito{\textquoteright}s generated code is compiled just in time and outperforms codes with manual performance optimizations. JUDI utilizes Julia{\textquoteright}s high-level parallelization, making the software easily adaptable to a variety of computing environments such as densely connected HPC clusters or the cloud. The numerical examples (Figure 3) demonstrate the ability to implement a variety of complex algorithms for FWI and LS-RTM in a few lines of Julia code and run it on large-scale 3D models. The paper concludes that abstractions and performance are not mutually exclusive, and use of symbolic user interfaces can facilitate the implementation of new and innovative seismic inversion algorithms.},

To overcome this conundrum, we make use of raw and processed data from nearby surveys. We propose to use this data, consisting of shot records or velocity models, to pre-train a neural network to correct for the effects of, for instance, the free surface or numerical dispersion, both of which can be considered as proxies for incomplete or inaccurate physics. Given this pre-trained neural network, we apply transfer learning to finetune this pre-trained neural network so it performs well on its task of mapping low-cost, but low-fidelity, solutions to high-fidelity solutions for the current survey. As long as we can limit ourselves during finetuning to using only a small fraction of high-fidelity data, we gain processing the current survey while using information from nearby surveys. We demonstrate this principle by removing surface-related multiples and ghosts from shot records and the effects of numerical dispersion from migrated images and wave simulations},

Software frameworks therefore need to combine both versatility and performance to provide geophysicists with the means and flexibility to implement complex algorithms that scale to exceedingly large 3D problems. Following these principles, we introduce the Julia Devito Inversion framework, an open-source software package in Julia for large-scale seismic modeling and inversion based on Devito, a domain-specific language compiler for automatic code generation. The framework consists of matrix-free linear operators for implementing seismic inversion algorithms that closely resembles the mathematical notation, a flexible resilient parallelization and an interface to Devito for generating optimized stencil code to solve the underlying wave equations. In comparison to many manually optimized industry codes written in low-level languages, our software is built on the idea of independent layers of abstractions and user interfaces with symbolic operators, making it possible to manage both the complexity of algorithms and performance optimizations, while preserving modularity, which allows for a level of expressiveness needed to formulate a broad range of wave-equation-based inversion problems. Through a series of numerical examples, we demonstrate that this allows users to implement algorithms for waveform inversion and imaging as simple Julia scripts that scale to large-scale 3D problems; thus providing a truly performant research and production framework.},

In this work, we consider the case where we deal with incomplete physics. One proxy of incomplete physics is an inaccurate discretization of Laplacian in simulation of wave equation via finite-difference method. We exploit intrinsic one-to-one similarities between timestepping algorithm with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and propose to intersperse CNNs between low-fidelity timesteps. Augmenting neural networks with low-fidelity timestepping algorithms may allow us to take large timesteps while limiting the numerical dispersion artifacts. While simulating the wave-equation with low-fidelity timestepping algorithm, by correcting the wavefield several time during propagation, we hope to limit the numerical dispersion artifact introduced by a poor discretization of the Laplacian. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this principle by correcting for numerical dispersion by keeping the velocity model fixed, and varying the source locations to generate training and testing pairs for our supervised learning algorithm.},

When the imaging step itself is not handled properly, this may possibly offset gains offered by deep learning. Motivated by our work on deep convolutional neural networks in seismic data reconstruction, we discuss how generative networks can be employed in prestack problems ranging from the relatively mondane removal of the effects of the free surface to dealing with the complex effects of numerical dispersion in time-domain finite differences.

The main complexity arising from transverse tilted isotropic imaging is to model the receiver wavefield (back propagation of the data or data residual) for the imaging condition. Unlike the isotropic or the full physics wave-equations, the transverse tilted isotropic wave-equation is not not self-adjoint. This difference means that time-reversal will not model the correct receiver wavefield and this can lead to incorrect subsurface images.

Back in the 80{\textquoteright}s and early 90{\textquoteright}s, the oil \& gas industry was among the main drivers of HPC technology with a resurgence about ten years ago with the advent of full-waveform inversion-i.e., an adjoint-state method for inverse problems that involve the wave equation. While the combination of hardware developments and tedious manual coding efforts have resulted in major improvements, the rate of innovations is slow in part because of the inherent complexities of the mostly monolithic code bases. As a result, innovations make it too slowly into these optimized codes. This stifles innovation and could prevent adaptation of important developments such as machine learning with deep convolutional neural networks into existing workflows. In comparison, the technological advances in the academic as well as commercial machine learning communities have been much faster in part because of robust and well abstracted code bases such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Since both machine learning and adjoint-state methods rely on back propagation strong similarities exist ready to be exploited. During my talk, I will discuss lessons we learned in finding the appropriate abstractions, read Domain Specific Language, for time-stepping stencil-based finite differences in Devito, and how this is relevant for machine learning with deep networks. I will also share a vision on how ideas from machine learning can be merged into the development of the next-generation of wave-equation based imaging codes. In particular, I will demonstrate the remarkable ability of deep convolutional networks to map low-fidelity dispersed numerical wave simulations to high-fidelity ones. I feel that this apparently generalizable capability of neural nets opens a complete new approach to tackle fundamental problems in computational exploration seismology.},

Preliminary studies showed the ability to reconstruct the optical absorption map of an in silico vessel phantom. By using a sparsity-promoting imaging method, absorption maps and source-time functions can still be recovered even in situations where the number of transducers is decreased by a factor of six. Moreover, the recovery is able to attain higher resolution than conventional beamforming methods. Because our method recovers the source-time function of the absorbers, it could potentially also be used to distinguish different types of photoabsorbers, or the degree of aggregation of exogenous agents, under the assumption that these would generate different source-time functions at the moment of laser irradiation.},

	abstract = {Adjoint-state full-waveform inversion aims to obtain subsurface properties such as velocity, density or anisotropy parameters, from surface recorded data. As with any (non-stochastic) gradient based optimization procedure, the solution of this inversion procedure is to a large extend determined by the quality of the starting model. If this starting model is too far from the true model, these derivative-based optimizations will likely end up in local minima and erroneous inversion results. In certain cases, extension of the search space, e.g. by making the wavefields or focused matched sources additional unknowns, has removed some of these non-uniqueness issues but these rely on time-harmonic formulations. Here, we follow a different approach by combining an implicit extension of the velocity model, time compression techniques and recent results on stochastic sampling in non-smooth/non-convex optimization},

	abstract = {We propose a wave-equation-based subsurface inversion method that in many cases is more robust than conventional Full-Waveform Inversion. The new formulation is written in a denoising form that allows the synthetic data to match the observed ones up to a small error. Compared to regular Full-Waveform Inversion, our method treats the noise arising from the data meassuring/recording process and that from the synthetic modelling process separately. Compared to Wavefields Reconstruction Inversion, the new formulation mitigates the difficulty of choosing the penalty parameter λ. To solve the proposed optimization problem, we develop an efficient frequency domain algorithm that alternatively updates the model and the data. Numerical experiments confirm strong stability of the proposed method by comparisons between the results of our algorithm with that from both plain FWI and a weighted formulation of the FWI. We also discuss a new memory efficient time-domain formulation for Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion based on duality.},

	abstract = {Exploration geophysics heavily relies upon fast solvers for the wave-equation and its adjoint. The main computational cost of a wave-equation solver is to compute the Laplacian, or more complex finite-difference operators, at every time step. The performance of many discretizations is limited by the relatively low operational intensity (number of floating point operations divided by memory traffic) of the finite-difference stencil. Solving the wave-equation for multiple sources/right-hand-sides (RHSs) at once mitigates this problem by increasing the operational intensity. This is implemented by rewriting the classical matrix-vector product into a matrix-matrix product where each column of the second matrix represent the solution wavefield for each given source. This minor modification to the solver is shown to achieve a 2-4 times speedup compared to a single source solver. We concentrate in this paper on acoustic modelling, but our approach can easily be extended to anisotropic or elastic cases for both forward and adjoint modelling.},

	abstract = {The life-cycle of a partial differential equation (PDE) solver is often characterized by three development phases: the development of a stable numerical discretization; development of a correct (verified) implementation; and the optimization of the implementation for different computer architectures. Often it is only after significant time and effort has been invested that the performance bottlenecks of a PDE solver are fully understood, and the precise details varies between different computer architectures. One way to mitigate this issue is to establish a reliable performance model that allows a numerical analyst to make reliable predictions of how well a numerical method would perform on a given computer architecture, before embarking upon potentially long and expensive implementation and optimization phases. The availability of a reliable performance model also saves developer effort as it both informs the developer on what kind of optimisations are beneficial, and when the maximum expected performance has been reached and optimisation work should stop. We show how discretization of a wave-equation can be theoretically studied to understand the performance limitations of the method on modern computer architectures. We focus on the roofline model, now broadly used in the high-performance computing community, which considers the achievable performance in terms of the peak memory bandwidth and peak floating point performance of a computer with respect to algorithmic choices. A first principles analysis of operational intensity for key time-stepping finite-difference algorithms is presented. With this information available at the time of algorithm design, the expected performance on target computer systems can be used as a driver for algorithm design.},

	abstract = {Numerical solvers for the wave equation are a key component of Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) and Reverse-Time Migration (RTM). The main computational cost of a wave-equation solver stems from the computation of the Laplacian at each time step. When using a finite difference discretization this can be characterized as a structured grid computation within Colella{\textquoteright}s Seven Dwarfs. Independent of the degree of parallelization the performance will be limited by the relatively low operational intensity (number of operations divided by memory traffic) of finite-difference stencils, that is so say that the method is memory bandwidth bound. For this reason many developers have focused on porting their code to platforms that have higher memory bandwidth, such as GPU{\textquoteright}s, or put significant effort into highly intrusive optimisations. However, these optimisations rarely strike the right performance vs productivity balance as the software becomes less maintainable and extensible. By solving the wave equation for multiple sources/right-hand-sides (RHSs) at once, we overcome this problem arriving at a time-stepping solver with higher operational intensity. In essence, we arrive at this result by turning the usual matrix-vector products into a matrix-matrix products where the first matrix implements the discretized wave equation and each column of the second matrix contain separate wavefields for each given source. By making this relatively minor change to the solver we readily achieved a $\times2$ speedup. While we limit ourselves to acoustic modeling, our approach can easily be extended to the anisotropic or elastic cases.},

As a result, we arrive at a formulation where the sensitivity to cycle skipping is reduced. Our method obtains results with the same computational costs as FWI (The PDE solved is the same) but with significantly reduced memory costs. We use new results in non-convex optimization to justify the method as well as new regularization techniques and stochastic optimization to improve the behavior of the algorithm.},

	abstract = {This note provides an overview on strategies for modeling and inversion with the anisotropic wave equation. Since linear and non-linear inversion methods like least squares RTM and Full Waveform Inversion depend on matching observed field data with synthetically modelled data, accounting for anisotropy effects is necessary in order to accurately match waveforms at long offsets and propagation times. In this note, the two main strategies for anisotropic modelling by solving either a pseudo acoustic wave equation or a pure quasi-P-wave equation are discussed and an inversion workflow using the pure quasi-P-wave equation is provided. In particular, we derive the exact adjoint of the anisotropic forward modelling and jacobian operator and give a detailled describtion of their implementation. The anistropic FWI workflow is tested on a sythetic data example.},

	abstract = {A framework is proposed for regularizing the waveform inversion problem by projections onto intersections of convex sets. Multiple pieces of prior information about the geology are represented by multiple convex sets, for example limits on the velocity or minimum smoothness conditions on the model. The data-misfit is then minimized, such that the estimated model is always in the intersection of the convex sets. Therefore, it is clear what properties the estimated model will have at each iteration. This approach does not require any quadratic penalties to be used and thus avoids the known problems and limitations of those types of penalties. It is shown that by formulating waveform inversion as a constrained problem, regularization ideas such as Tikhonov regularization and gradient filtering can be incorporated into one framework. The algorithm is generally applicable, in the sense that it works with any (differentiable) objective function and does not require significant additional computation. The method is demonstrated on the inversion of the 2D marine isotropic elastic synthetic seismic benchmark by Chevron using an acoustic modeling code. To highlight the effect of the projections, we apply no data pre-processing. This is joint work with Bas Peters.},

	abstract = {Common strategies to regularize waveform inversion (and other geophysical inverse problems) are adding quadratic penalty terms to the objective function or filtering the gradients used to update the model estimate. An example are penalties or filters to prevent/filter spurious high spatial frequency oscillations in the model while working with low frequency data. We present an alternative way of regularization, which works by projecting the model onto an intersection of convex sets, where each sets encodes certain desired model properties. This approach has certain theoretical and practical advantages over quadratic penalties or gradient filters. Some examples of useful convex sets in various challenging waveform inversion settings are shown on both real and synthetic data.},

Our algorithm is particularly suitable to large-scale geophysical inversion problems, such as sparse least-squares reverse-time migration or Kirchoff migration since it allows for a tradeoff between parallel computations, memory allocation, and turnaround times, by working on subsets of the data with different sizes. Comparison of the proposed method for sparse least-squares imaging shows a performance that rivals and even exceeds the performance of state-of-the art one-norm solvers that are able to carry out least-squares migration at the cost of a single migration with all data.},

	abstract = {Time-domain Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) aims to image the subsurface of the earth accurately from field recorded data and can be solved via the reduced adjoint-state method. However, this method requires access to the forward and adjoint wavefields that are meet when computing gradient updates. The challenge here is that the adjoint wavefield is computed in reverse order during time stepping and therefore requires storage or other type of mitigation because storing the full time history of the forward wavefield is too expensive in realistic 3D settings. To overcome this challenge, we propose an approximate adjoint-state method where the wavefields are subsampled randomly, which drastically the amount of storage needed. By using techniques from stochastic optimization, we control the errors induced by the subsampling. Examples of the proposed technique on a synthetic but realistic 2D model show that the subsampling-related artifacts can be reduced significantly by changing the sampling for each source after each model update. Combination of this gradient approximation with a quasi-Newton method shows virtually artifact free inversion results requiring only 5\% of storage compared to saving the history at Nyquist. In addition, we avoid having to recompute the wavefields as is required by checkpointing.},
